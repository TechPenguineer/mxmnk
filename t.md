It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

1. The project was created by the developer born in Germany or self-indicate themself as German.
2. The project has more that 1000 stars on Github.

**(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)**
